1. Derive the Ergun's equation for pressure drop in packed bed. What are the assumptions made?
	What are the limitations for the application of Ergun's equation?<br>
2. Define sphericity, equivalent particle diameter and specific surface area.<br>
3. Packed bed is composed of cubes 0.02 m and the bulk density of the packed bed is 980kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The density of the solid cubes is 1500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<br>
a. Calculate the void fraction (<img src="images/CodeCogsEqn (76).gif"></img>) and effective diameter (D<sub>p</sub>).<br>
b. What is the void fraction if the cubes are replaced with cylinders that have a diameter 0.02 m and a height 0.02 m, all other parameters remaining the same?
